## 🧠 System Overview

PresSync operates using two key concepts:

### **1. Event Categories**

Templates defining:

* event start/end time
* attendance window
* repeating schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, custom day-of-week)
* instance generation rules

### **2. Event Instances**

Concrete events automatically created based on category rules.

Attendance is linked to event instances, not categories — ensuring accurate statistics over time.
